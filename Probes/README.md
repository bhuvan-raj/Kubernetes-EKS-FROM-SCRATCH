## What are Kubernetes Probes?

Kubernetes probes are diagnostic checks performed periodically by the Kubelet (the agent running on each node) on your containers within a Pod. They evaluate the health and readiness state of your application and allow Kubernetes to take specific actions based on the probe's outcome.

## Why are Probes Important?

Probes are fundamental to:

  * **Automated Self-Healing:** Automatically restarting unhealthy containers.
  * **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** Ensuring new application versions are ready before receiving traffic.
  * **Graceful Scaling:** Adding and removing pods from service efficiently.
  * **Improved Reliability:** Preventing traffic from being routed to unresponsive or unready application instances.
  * **Robustness against Issues:** Handling situations like deadlocks, resource exhaustion, or temporary external service outages.

-----

## Types of Probes

Kubernetes offers three distinct types of probes, each serving a unique purpose in a container's lifecycle:

### 1\. Liveness Probe

**Purpose:**
The Liveness Probe determines if your application is **alive** and **healthy enough to continue running**. It checks if the application process is still executing and hasn't fallen into a deadlocked or unresponsive state.

**When to Use It:**

  * When your application can be "alive" (process running) but "sick" (e.g., stuck in an infinite loop, out of memory, deadlocked, or unable to serve requests).
  * For self-healing: to automatically restart a misbehaving container to restore its health.

**Behavior on Failure:**

  * If a liveness probe fails a configured number of times (`failureThreshold`), the container is **terminated (killed)**.
  * The container is then **restarted** according to the Pod's `restartPolicy` (defaulting to `Always`).

**Example Scenario:**
An HTTP server that accepts connections but has an internal deadlock preventing it from returning responses. A `httpGet` liveness probe hitting `/healthz` would eventually time out or get an incorrect status, causing Kubernetes to restart the Nginx container, hopefully resolving the deadlock.

**YAML Example (Liveness Probe):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-docker-repo/my-app:1.0
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz # Endpoint to check
        port: 8080    # Port the app listens on
      initialDelaySeconds: 15 # Wait 15 seconds after container starts before first check
      periodSeconds: 20       # Check every 20 seconds
      timeoutSeconds: 5       # Consider failed if no response in 5 seconds
      failureThreshold: 3     # After 3 consecutive failures, restart the container
```

### 2\. Readiness Probe

**Purpose:**
The Readiness Probe determines if a container is **ready to start accepting network traffic**. It checks if your application has completed its startup routines (e.g., loaded configurations, connected to databases, warmed up caches) and is fully capable of serving requests.

**When to Use It:**

  * When your application takes time to initialize after its process starts.
  * To ensure zero-downtime deployments and graceful traffic shifting during updates or scaling.
  * For applications that can temporarily become unavailable (e.g., database connection briefly drops) but don't need a full restart; simply remove them from service until they recover.

**Behavior on Failure:**

  * If a readiness probe fails, the Pod's IP address is **removed from the Endpoints object of all Kubernetes Services** that match the Pod.
  * **No new traffic** will be routed to the Pod by Services.
  * The container **is NOT restarted**.
  * When the probe succeeds again, the Pod's IP is added back to Service Endpoints.

**Example Scenario:**
A Spring Boot application that takes 60 seconds to fully initialize its context and connect to a database. A readiness probe would prevent traffic from being sent to this Pod until it's genuinely ready, avoiding "connection refused" or 503 errors for users.

**YAML Example (Readiness Probe):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: readiness-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-docker-repo/my-app:1.0
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /ready     # A dedicated endpoint for readiness check
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Can start checking relatively early
      periodSeconds: 5       # Check more frequently for readiness
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      failureThreshold: 1    # Mark as unready after just one failure
```

### 3\. Startup Probe

**Purpose:**
The Startup Probe is specifically designed for applications that have a **long and potentially unpredictable startup time**. When a startup probe is configured, all other probes (liveness and readiness) are **disabled** until the startup probe successfully passes. This gives the application ample time to fully initialize without being prematurely killed or marked unready.

**When to Use It:**

  * When your application takes a very long time to start (e.g., downloading large files, database migrations, extensive initialization).
  * To prevent aggressive liveness probes from restarting a container before it even has a chance to complete its initial setup.

**Behavior on Failure:**

  * If the startup probe fails after its configured `failureThreshold` and `periodSeconds`, Kubernetes considers the container's startup to have failed.
  * The container is **terminated** and **restarted** according to the Pod's `restartPolicy`.

**Example Scenario:**
A complex data processing application that takes several minutes to load initial datasets into memory. A startup probe with a high `failureThreshold` and `periodSeconds` would ensure it completes this heavy lifting without being interrupted, after which the regular liveness and readiness probes take over.

**YAML Example (Startup Probe):**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: startup-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-docker-repo/my-app:1.0
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /startup # Endpoint dedicated to initial startup
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 0  # Start checking immediately
      periodSeconds: 5        # Check every 5 seconds
      failureThreshold: 120   # Allow up to 10 minutes (120 * 5s) for startup
      timeoutSeconds: 3
    livenessProbe: # Liveness and Readiness probes are inactive until startup probe passes
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: 8080
      periodSeconds: 10
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 8080
      periodSeconds: 5
```

## Common Probe Configuration Parameters

All probe types (`livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, `startupProbe`) share these common fields:

  * `initialDelaySeconds` (int, default: 0): Number of seconds after the container has started before probes are initiated.
  * `periodSeconds` (int, default: 10): How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
  * `timeoutSeconds` (int, default: 1): Number of seconds after which the probe times out. If the check doesn't return success within this time, it's considered a failure.
  * `successThreshold` (int, default: 1): Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed.
  * `failureThreshold` (int, default: 3): After how many consecutive failures should Kubernetes take action (restart for Liveness/Startup, remove from Service for Readiness).

-----

## Probe Handlers

Kubernetes offers various methods to perform the actual health check:

### `exec` action

Executes a specified command inside the container.

  * **Success:** Command exits with status code 0.
  * **Failure:** Command exits with a non-zero status code.
  * **Use Case:** Checking internal application state, file system presence, or running diagnostic scripts.

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
exec:
  command:
    - cat
    - /tmp/healthy
```

### `httpGet` action

Performs an HTTP GET request against a specified endpoint.

  * **Success:** HTTP response code is between 200 and 399 (inclusive).
  * **Failure:** Any other response code, or if the connection fails.
  * **Use Case:** Web servers, APIs, or any application exposing an HTTP health endpoint.

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
httpGet:
  path: /healthz
  port: 8080
  # host: Defaults to Pod IP. Can be overridden.
  # scheme: HTTP or HTTPS. Defaults to HTTP.
  # httpHeaders: Optional custom headers.
```

### `tcpSocket` action

Attempts to open a TCP connection to a specified port.

  * **Success:** TCP connection can be established.
  * **Failure:** Connection cannot be established.
  * **Use Case:** Databases, messaging queues, or any application that opens a specific port for communication.

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
tcpSocket:
  port: 3306 # Example for MySQL
```

### `grpc` action (Kubernetes 1.24+ with feature gate)

Performs a gRPC health check. Requires the gRPC Health Checking Protocol to be implemented by the application.

  * **Use Case:** Microservices communicating via gRPC.
  * **Note:** Requires the `GRPCContainerProbe` [feature gate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) to be enabled in your cluster (if using versions where it's not GA).

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
grpc:
  port: 50051
  # service: optional gRPC service name to check
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

  * **Keep Probes Lightweight:** Health check endpoints should be fast and simple. Avoid heavy computations, database queries, or external service calls that could introduce latency or external dependencies into the probe logic.
  * **Meaningful Endpoints:** Ensure your probe endpoints truly reflect the health or readiness of your *application's functionality*, not just whether the process is running or a port is open.
  * **Balance Parameters:**
      * `initialDelaySeconds`: Give your application enough time to start without being prematurely restarted.
      * `periodSeconds`: Don't check too frequently (resource overhead) or too infrequently (slow detection of issues).
      * `timeoutSeconds`: Set it realistically for your health check endpoint's response time.
      * `failureThreshold`: Avoid "flappy" containers (too frequent restarts) by setting a reasonable threshold.
  * **Combine Probes Wisely:**
      * Most applications benefit from a combination of **Liveness** and **Readiness** probes.
      * If you have a slow-starting application, add a **Startup** probe to protect it during initialization.
  * **Logs and Events are Your Friends:**
      * Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to see probe events and failures.
      * Check `kubectl logs <pod-name>` for application-specific errors that might explain probe failures.
  * **Application Design for Probes:** Implement dedicated health check endpoints in your application code that expose relevant internal state. A `/healthz` for liveness, `/ready` for readiness, and perhaps `/startup` for startup checks can be very effective.
  * **Avoid Chained Dependencies in Liveness Probes:** A liveness probe should primarily check the internal state of the application. If it depends on an external service (like a database) that might temporarily be unavailable, you risk unnecessary container restarts. Readiness probes, however, *can* and often *should* check external dependencies to ensure the application is fully functional before receiving traffic.
  * **Testing:** Test your probes in a non-production environment. Simulate failures (e.g., block the health endpoint, stop a dependent service) to ensure Kubernetes reacts as expected.

## Comprehensive Example

This example demonstrates a single Pod using all three probe types with different handlers for illustrative purposes.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
    - containerPort: 50051 # For gRPC example
    
    # Startup Probe: For very slow-starting applications.
    # Liveness and Readiness probes are paused until this succeeds.
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /startup-check
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 0
      periodSeconds: 10       # Check every 10 seconds
      failureThreshold: 60    # Allow up to 10 minutes (60 * 10s = 600s) for startup
      timeoutSeconds: 5
    
    # Liveness Probe: Checks if the application is still running and healthy.
    # If fails, the container is restarted.
    livenessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 8080            # Check if TCP port is open
      initialDelaySeconds: 20 # Start checking after 20 seconds
      periodSeconds: 15       # Check every 15 seconds
      timeoutSeconds: 2
      failureThreshold: 3
    
    # Readiness Probe: Checks if the application is ready to serve traffic.
    # If fails, traffic is diverted away from this Pod.
    readinessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
          - /bin/sh
          - -c
          - "pgrep my-app-process && curl -f http://localhost:8080/app-status" # Example: Check process and HTTP endpoint
      initialDelaySeconds: 10 # Start checking after 10 seconds
      periodSeconds: 5        # Check every 5 seconds (more frequent for readiness)
      timeoutSeconds: 3
      failureThreshold: 2
      
  # Example of another container with gRPC probe
  - name: grpc-sidecar
    image: my-grpc-service:latest # Replace with your actual gRPC service image
    ports:
    - containerPort: 50051
    readinessProbe:
      grpc:
        port: 50051
        service: "my.package.MyService" # Optional: specific gRPC service to check
      periodSeconds: 10
      failureThreshold: 3
```
